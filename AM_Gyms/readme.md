This folder contains the following RL-environments:

- Frozen_lake_v2.py   : a 'less random' version of OpenAI's frozen lake environment
- Loss_Env.py         : a custom environment designed to test Measurement Regret
- NChainEnv.py        : an implementation of the (discontinued) OpenAI chain environment
- Blackjack.py        : a version of OpenAI's Blackjack environment, which returns non-factorised states.
- Sepsis folder       : a RL-environment introduced by Nam et al (2021) for Active Measure reinforced learning

For the first three, data can be found in the data folder. The other two were only tested briefly.
